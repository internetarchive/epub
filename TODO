To do:
epub:
- images (cf. best practices?)
- switch to incremental content generation
- make sure temp files get deleted!


daisy:
- Generate content!
- stylesheet decls get dropped from dtbook xml
- extract proper metadata (or pass it elseways)

Maybe someday:

- Small-caps font emulation
- Auto portrait/landscape scaling/rotation of images
- fix 'sample title' in process_abbyy
- Add code to iarchive.py to make sense of page numbers, e.g. unnumbered start pages, pages that start at '2', etc.  Romance is an initial example.  Also pageNumBox

- make sure required epub, daisy metadata is actually present

- get rid of common.py?
Skip line if too many chars are suspicious?
