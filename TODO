To do:
images (cf. best practices?)
etc.

Maybe someday:

- Small-caps font emulation
- Auto portrait/landscape scaling/rotation of images
- fix 'sample title' in process_abbyy
- Add code to iarchive.py to make sense of page numbers, e.g. unnumbered start pages, pages that start at '2', etc.  Romance is an initial example.  Also pageNumBox
