Code for creating epub files.

'epub.py' may be of general use.

The project as a whole is currently oriented towards converting
creating .epub files from Internet Archive book 'items', consisting of
metadata, 'abbyy' OCR output files, and page images.


Entry points -

* convert_iabook.py     - main Internet Archive book converter
* condense_abbyy.py     - create slightly-more-human-readable version of abbyy
* visualize_abbyy.py    - create a directory of page images, marked with OCR
                          (Needs currently un-checked-in fonts)
